# Michael Turza
### Senior Service Leader | Aspiring Software Architect | Python & InfoSec Student

I am a Senior Professional with 20 years of leadership experience in mission-critical service operations. I am currently bridging that expertise into Software Engineering, documenting my journey from a veteran leader to a technical builder.

**This profile serves as a professional portfolio for my past, present, and future projects.**

### The Professional Bridge
I treat software systems with the same high-availability standards required for offshore and sanctuary operations. My focus is on:
- **Reliability:** Building code that handles edge cases and stays "seaworthy".
- **Security:** Prioritizing data integrity and user protection from the first line of code.
- **Efficiency:** Transforming complex manual logistics into automated digital workflows.

### Current Technical Focus
I am currently immersed in a curriculum focused on modern software standards:
- **Languages:** Python (Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures) 🐍
- **Security:** Information Security principles, Secure Scripting, and PII protection 🛡️
- **Environment:** Version Control (Git/GitHub), Linux CLI, and Virtual Environments ⚙️
